# Team Policies and Expectations

## Instructor's Expectations and Responsabilities for All Students

### Project Iteration Responsibilities of the Team (as a Team)
* Together, determine the distribution of work and design this distribution so that it is possible for each team member to contribute a roughly equal effort toward the success of the project. Make your best guess about this at the start of the project, and refine the responsibilities if needed as you go. Consult the instructor if any issues arise or you need clarifications.

#### Distribution of Work
**Step 1: Please, provide here a brief description (one short paragraph) of the distribution of work across your team. You can refine this description as you carry out the project iteration.**

We are actively trying to distribute work evenly so that all team members are contributing equally to the project. Each week we discuss the parts of the project we are trying to work on, seek clarification from others when we need help, and have worked together to come up with a solution. This has worked more times than not, so it's still a good plan for our group.

### Project Responsibilities of the Individual
* Individually, contribute to the success of the team according to the policies and schedule agreed upon by all team members. Individually, create the opportunity for everyone in your group to succeed at being a good team member - don't do all the work yourself.

## Additional Expectations and Responsabilities Set by The Students
Establish your own additional team policies around the following aspects:

* Expectations for regular group meetings and synchronous class/lab attendance.
* Expectations for frequency, method, and response time for communication on Piazza.
* Expectations for using other forms of electronic communication.
* Expectations for frequency of contributions to the project.
* Expectations on how to communicate when things are not working as we expected.
* Others.

#### Additional Expectations and Responsabilities
**Step 2: Please, describe here (using as much text as you need) additional expections and responsabilities for this project iteration**.

The method that we used for the second project iteration worked well and we plan to use a similar process.

Our goal is to meet 2 or 3 times a week, but this will depend on the tasks that we are currently working on, and how much of it will be individual work. We will probably be meeting more when doing the diagrams than when we are writing tests. We plan on communicating on Piazza when we need help from instructors or clarification. Perhaps when we have more detailed questions/information we'll talk over Zoom.

We are texting about the project, and will continue to do so when needed. This will probably be used most to set up meeting times, communicate about class, or ask simpler questions.

We plan on creating deadlines for ourselves so that we are all contributing to the project around the same time and around the same amount. We find following recommended deadlines from the write up useful, and will create our own mini deadlines for individual tasks.

If simple things are not working as expected we will text each other. If they become more complicated, we will communicate over Piazza, and ask for instructor help when necessary.

## Team Member Names
**Step 3: Please enter your name. Each one of the team members should add the name through a different commit. For example, student A adds their name and commits, then student B adds their name and commits.**
